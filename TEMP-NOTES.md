Certainly! Here’s an explanation of the two segmentation functions in src/utils/data-processing/segmentation.ts:

1. segmentByImportantPeaks
Purpose:
This function segments a time series by identifying the k-1 most important peaks, which are used as segmentation points. The importance of a peak is determined by both its height (prominence) and its distance from other already selected peaks, aiming for a good distribution of segments.

How it works:

It first finds all peaks in the data and ranks them by normalized height.
For each selection round, it scores each remaining peak by how far it is from already selected peaks (or the boundaries) and how tall it is. The scoring formula is:
score = (closestDist / dataLength) * (height / 2)
The peak with the highest score is selected and removed from the list.
This repeats until all peaks are considered.
Finally, the function returns the first k-1 selected peaks, each as an object { idx, date }, where idx is the index in the time series and date is the corresponding date.
Use case:
This method is useful when you want to segment a time series into k parts at the most meaningful change points, balancing peak prominence and distribution.

2. segmentByImportantPeaks1
Purpose:
This function also segments a time series by identifying important peaks, but it uses a simpler, more direct approach that doesn’t rely on the Peak class or ranking.

How it works:

It identifies all local maxima (peaks) in the time series by checking each point against its immediate neighbors.
Each peak is assigned a prominence value (how much higher it is than its neighbors).
Peaks are sorted by prominence.
The function then selects up to k-1 peaks, ensuring that each selected peak is at least a minimum distance (deltaMax as a fraction of the series length) away from previously selected peaks.
The result is also returned as an array of objects { idx, date }.
Use case:
This method is more lightweight and is suitable when you want a fast, simple segmentation based on local maxima and a distance constraint, without the need for more complex peak objects or ranking logic.

Summary Table
| Function | Peak Detection Method | Scoring/Selection Logic | Output Format | Use case | |----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------| | segmentByImportantPeaks | Uses Peak class | Balances peak height & distribution| { idx, date }[] | Balanced, ranked segmentation | | segmentByImportantPeaks1 | Direct maxima search | Local prominence, min distance | { idx, date }[] | Fast, simple, distance-constrained |

Both functions now return the same output format, so you can use them interchangeably in your analysis and visualization code
